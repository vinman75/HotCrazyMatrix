Tired of anecdotal evidence and flawed methodologies in your dating life? It's time to bring scientific rigor to the chaos. This web application is a sophisticated tool for plotting, tracking, and analyzing data points on the legendary Hot-Crazy Matrix.

Because you can't argue with a chart.

### The Foundational Research

This entire project is based on the groundbreaking scientific theory presented by Professor B. Stinson.

#### How to Secure Your Research Account

Your highly sensitive data is for your eyes only.
1.  Proceed to the secure registration portal: **[https://hot-crazy-matrix.duckdns.org/auth/register](https://hot-crazy-matrix.duckdns.org/auth/register)**
2.  Choose a memorable alias (username) and a secure passcode (password, min. 8 characters).
3.  Click "Register".
4.  Log in and commence your research.

## üìà The Interface

The application features a clean and responsive interface, optimized for both detailed analysis at your main lab station (desktop) and quick data entry in the field (mobile).

### Responsive Design for Lab & Field Work

The user interface is built with a "liquid" or responsive layout that automatically adapts to the screen size of your device.

*   **On Desktop**: The control panel and the chart are displayed side-by-side. This wide format takes advantage of the available screen space, allowing you to see your data and controls simultaneously without scrolling.
*   **On Mobile**: The layout stacks vertically. The control panel collapses into an accordion at the top, and the chart is given a taller aspect ratio (`min-height: 60vh`). This ensures that the chart remains large, clear, and easy to interact with on a narrow phone screen.

## üî¨ The Science (Features)

*   **Top-Secret User Accounts**: Your research is yours alone. All data is securely partitioned under your private account.
*   **Interactive Specimen Analysis**: Plot data points directly on the chart with a simple click. No Ph.D. required.
*   **Longitudinal Studies**: Add, track, edit, and (if necessary) delete "Girls" and their associated data points over time.
*   **The Vickie Mendoza Diagonal**: The infamous dividing line is clearly marked, ensuring you never stray into the No-Go Zone unprepared.
*   **Advanced Zone Calculation**: The system automatically calculates the average position of each subject, clearly identifying their location in the Fun Zone, Wife Zone, Danger Zone, or even the mythical Unicorn Zone.
*   **Day & Night Research Modes**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable data analysis, no matter the hour.
*   **Dockerized & Portable Lab**: The entire application is containerized, so you can set up your own private research lab anywhere.

## üß™ The Lab (Tech Stack)

*   **Backend**: Flask, Gunicorn
*   **Database**: SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Flask-Migrate
*   **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Chart.js, JavaScript
*   **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üê≥ Deploying Your Own Research Lab

Want to host your own private instance? Easy. You just need **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

#### Step 1: Acquire the Lab Schematics (Clone Repo)

Get the code on your local machine or server.

```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]
